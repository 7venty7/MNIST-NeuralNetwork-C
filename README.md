A neural network for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, written from scratch in C with no external libraries.

This is not a serious project with any real application, but purely for the sake of better understanding the math behind Neural Networks, inspired by 3blue1brown.

The model contains 1 hidden layer with 300 neurons and currently achieves a ~95% accuracy on test data

# Usage
- The binary executable to train the network can be produced by running "make"
- Running this binary: "./train", will train the network and produce 4 csv files corresponding to matrices associated with weights and biases
